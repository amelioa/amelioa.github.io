            Crown shyness(also canopy disengagement,[1] canopy shyness,[2] or inter-crown spacing[3]) is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.[4][5] The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of different species.[6][7] There exist many hyptheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.[8]

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is not certain.[6] The phenomenon has been discusses in scientific literature since the 1920s.[9] The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across different species, an exa,ple of convergent evolution.

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees. Trees in windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during winds. As the result of abrasions and collisions, there is an induced crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbors until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.[10] If the crowns are artifcially
