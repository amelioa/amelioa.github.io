        <h1>Adoption Information</h1>
        <p>
            Thank you for considering adopting a cafe cat from Calico Cafe! Our cats are all rescued from local shelters and brought to our cafe to find their forever homes. We work closely with our adoption partners to ensure that each cat is matched with the right family and that our cats are placed in responsible and loving homes. Here's what you need to know about adopting a cafe cat:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Meet our Cats: We have a variety of cats available for adoption, each with their own unique personality and needs. You can visit our cafe to meet our cats and spend some time getting to know them. Our staff will be happy to introduce you to each cat and answer any questions you may have about their personalities or medical history.

                Adoption Application: If you find a cat you are interested in adopting, you will need to fill out an adoption application. This application helps us to get to know you and to ensure that our cats are placed in responsible and loving homes. You will need to provide personal information such as your name, address, and contact information, as well as information about your home and lifestyle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adoption Process: Once your application has been reviewed and approved, we will schedule a home visit to ensure that your home is a safe and suitable environment for the cat you are interested in adopting. If the home visit is approved, you will then be able to schedule a time to come pick up your new cat from our cafe.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adoption Fee: Our adoption fee helps us to cover the cost of medical care, food, and other expenses associated with caring for our cats. The fee varies depending on the cat's age and medical history, but typically ranges from $50 to $150.
            </li>
            <li>
                Post-Adoption Support: We are committed to ensuring that our cats are placed in responsible and loving homes, and we offer post-adoption support to help you and your new cat adjust to life together. We provide advice on cat care, behavior issues, and other concerns you may have. We also offer free veterinary consultations within the first 30 days after adoption.
