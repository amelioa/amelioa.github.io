        <h1>Ways to Help</h1>
        <p>
            Thank you for your interest in supporting Calico Cafe and our mission to rescue cats in need! We appreciate any and all contributions to help us provide a safe and loving environment for our feline friends. Here are some ways you can help support our cause:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Make a Donation: We rely on donations from generous supporters like you to help us rescue and care for cats. You can make a one-time or recurring donation online through our website. Your donation will go towards providing food, shelter, and medical care for our cats, as well as helping us to continue our rescue efforts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Volunteer: We are always in need of volunteers to help us care for our cats and run our cafe. If you love cats and want to make a difference in their lives, consider volunteering with us. You can help with feeding, cleaning, and socializing our cats, as well as assisting with events and other tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sponsor a Cat: If you are not able to adopt a cat but still want to make a difference, consider sponsoring one of our cats. Your donation will go towards providing food, shelter, and medical care for the cat, as well as helping us to find them a forever home. You will receive updates on your sponsored cat's progress and can visit them at our cafe.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adopt a Cat: If you are looking to add a furry friend to your family, consider adopting one of our cats. Our adoption process is designed to ensure that each cat finds a loving and responsible forever home. We work closely with our adoption partners to match our cats with the right families and provide support to new pet owners.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread the Word: Help us raise awareness about our mission by spreading the word about Calico Cafe. Follow us on social media, share our posts, and tell your friends and family about our cafe and rescue efforts. Every little bit helps to make a difference in the lives of cats in need.
            </li>
